        <li>The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of colors in the sequence.</li>
        <li>A color can be used only once in a code sequence.</li>
        <li>After filling a line with your guesses, the game responses with the result of your guess.</li>
        <li>For each color in your guess that is in the correct color and correct position in the code sequence, the game displays a small red color.</li>
        <li>For each color in your guess that is in the correct color but is NOT in the correct position in the code sequence, the game displays a small white color.</li>
        <li>You win the game if you guess the exact sequence chosen by your opponent.</li>
        <li>You lose the game if you use all attempts without guessing the actual sequence.</li>
